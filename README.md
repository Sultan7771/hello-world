Hello world.

So the first app is complete, but the UI and functionality is very limited and time consuming to change only with kivy and python. It's time i started to learn more about app development. So let's have a look at all the key skills an andorid app developer needs to work. I'll use this as a personal skill checklist to develop myself. I cba with doing anymore sessions on Udemy. I have no ambition to go into data science...for now anyway.

From the research conducted the following programming languages/applications/something need to be learned:


1. Kotlin

*Similar to what python is for C+, kotlin seems likes a more modern and concise way of coding java...so bye bye java for now
*Android studio is used as the IDE for kotlin, 3 birds with the same stone right now. this is sounding promisiing.

2. MVVM Pattern
3. Solid & Clean code principles
4. GIT
5. Agile Scrum
6. Android Studio
